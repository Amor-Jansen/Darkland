This is an interactive 2d scroller game. My aim is to provide something fun and with increasing difficulty as you advance through
the levels. Using nothing but JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build this game.

The story of the game is there has been a huge attack on earth and you are an animal just trying to survive the apocalypse. Avoid the mutant creatures, fond food and saftey.

Design

Colour scheme

    Through out this website I used a parchment colour #F8F0E3 as the main font colour.
    The background colour is #008385, this is set in place if the background image fails.

Typography

    I used Shalimar as a heading font. I like how it looks like cursive but is not difficult to read.
    I used Overpass for the rest of the body, I feel like it looks clean and again simple to read.
    Both fonts were imported from Google fonts.
