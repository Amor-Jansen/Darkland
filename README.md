This is an interactive 2d scroller game. My aim is to provide something fun and with increasing difficulty as you advance through
the levels. Using nothing but JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build this game.

The story of the game is there has been a huge attack on earth and you are an animal just trying to survive the apocalypse. Avoid the mutant creatures, fond food and saftey.
